                Around December of 2021, I found a video about controlling LEDs
                in 3D space for a Christmas tree. It was absolutely fascinating
                and I knew immediately that I wanted to do it myself. There was
                one small issue though, the video was not technical in the
                slightest. It was heavily based around what the general process
                was but it was not a guide for how to set up the LEDs, how
                program them, or really HOW to do anything. For those
                interested, the link to the video is
                <a

                ><br /><br />
                Being a programming novice who was painfully aware of how new I
                was to the field, I left the project for better days.

              <div id="paraTitle2">The Better Days</div>
              <div id="mainBody2">
                One day in July of 2022, the Google algorithm gods looked down
                upon me and said "now's as good a time as any" and a video popped
                into my YouTube feed. It was pretty unassuming, just a guide on
                how to wire some WS2811 LEDs. I watched the video and came to
                the realization that, I knew how to start!<br /><br />
                Now of course, I did know a good way to start the project, as it
                semi-prominently featured in the video I watched initially
                regarding Christmas trees, but more importantly, I knew how to
                write the code.<br /><br />
                And so my journey began.

            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="procedureNote1Cont">
              <div id="procedureNote1">At this point it is important to note how the code is being executed. 
                All of the code I had written was executing on the Raspberry Pi. This is because the only way 
                to control the lights is through the PWM pins on the Pi.
                Because all the code is being executed on the Pi, all of the calculations necessary to run the
                 program are also being done on the Pi, and the Pi is significantly slower than my, or anybody's,
                  laptop or computer. This becomes a problem later.
                <br/><br/>
                Also included in my verion control is some prototypical code for capturing images of the lights, 
                this code is iterated on frequently and is extremely important as the project progresses.
                <br/><br/>
                Another piece of ineffiency to mention is the fact that all the lights that I wish to turn on, are
                 being sent, through SSH, as arguments on the command line. Think for a second, if I had 300 lights,
                  thats some 1000 characters required to turn the lights on. This would be remedied quickly.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="code2DescCont">
              <div id="code2Desc">Here is a bit of code I wrote to create a "center out" pattern. Using the center
                 coordinate, I find every light's distance from the center and I sort a final list by that distance. Iterating through
                each light in the list and showing it is how the pattern is created.
                <br/><br/>
                This is the foundation for the Closest function, a function that is used in almost every pattern
                 i have created and if there was a single spot that I would target for computation time improvements,
                  this function would be it.

            <div class="rotationTestDescCont">
              <div id="rotationTestDesc">After a couple of small optimizations, like including the light coordinates
                  as a supplemental text file and being able to execute a certain program from a centralized exec file,
                  I moved on to tackle rotation.
                <br/><br/>
                The goal here was to create some really nice mathematical patterns using rotation. Rotation is a little 
                tough, or at least it is when you don't know what you are doing. It just so happens that in the process of finding an effective method to represent
                rotation, I derived the 2 dimensional rotation matrix.
